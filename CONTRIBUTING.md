# Contributor Workflow

* If you'd like to report a bug, just fire up an [issue](), we'll get it marked *bug* and we can all take a look at it.
* If you'd like to add a feature request, just create an [issue]() and describe what you'd like the component to include as a feature. We'll then determine if it's a good add on to the core library and contact you to determine how we can dole out the work.
* If you'd like to add code, tell us the feature you'd like to add via an [issue](). We'll then discuss it via the issue item. Then just fork the repository, build the feature and submit a pull request. We'll then review and merge the pull request pending tests pass.
